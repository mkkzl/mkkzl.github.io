  <p class="lead">This is a resource for learning how to help develop eco-friendly, self-reliant, and sustainable environments in Florida.</p>

  <p> The Mobile Museum is an adaptable, eco-centric resource structure that endeavors to bring museum learning and engagement out of its institutional walls, and into the future of its surrounding community. By utilizing green spaces in and around existing museums, Mobile Museum educates and offers hands-on opportunities to learn more about what visitors can do to transform their home and community into a more eco-friendly, self-reliant, and sustainable environment.</p>
  <p>Around the museum are different areas where visitors can observe non-invasive and native plants to their area that produce veggies to pick, fruits to pluck, and plants to pollinate. Our goal is to equip museum staff with the knowledge and appropriate resources to offer to their visitors, donors, and community at large. We connect the museum with different local organizations already working in sustainability and farming, businesses who offer materials and resources, and provide a platform that the public can implement into their specific surroundings. </p>
  <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
  <p class="mb-0" style=" padding: 50px; color: #6cc3d5;">Museums are synonymous with education, adventure, wonder, and curiosity - <br>why should that end when you walk out of the front doors?
</p>
</blockquote>
  <p> By working with Mobile Museum the greenspace museum experience can be packed up and sent home with visitors via their <em style="color:#f3969a;">Mobile-Maker-Kit</em>. In working with so many members, visitors, donors, local organizations and businesses the museum acts as a conduit for positive change and remains a steadfast sustainable hub within a city. </p>
  <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">Mobile-Maker-Kit</h4>
  <p>There are many ways to translate your greenspace experience from the museum grounds, to your urban lifestyle. In the Mobile-Maker-Kit’s the museum teams up with local organizations and businesses to supply visitors with everything they need to begin their own space-optimized gardens, as well as all information needed regarding composting, recipes to go with their native plant options, workshops and tips for further community engagement. </p>
