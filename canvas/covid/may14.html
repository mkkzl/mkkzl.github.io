  <h1>May 14 </h1>
  <p>My mom and I go to stand outside her door. There is a large #1 on a white sheet of paper taped to the door to tell us it is her room. The nurses finish bathing her and turn her to face us. Her eyes are not open. My aunt comes. We stand close and talk to one another as we stare into her room. We do not hug one another. My mom and I leave. I say goodbye again.
20:45 the phone rings. I donâ€™t need to hear anything other than that. I know.
