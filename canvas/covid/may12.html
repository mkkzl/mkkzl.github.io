  <h1>May 12 </h1>
  <p> May 12th
She is moved to hospice. We are told she has 24 hours. I call to say goodbye. I talk about the birds outside that are chirping. And how I remember her singing back to the birds. I can hear her moan some. The nurse says her breathing slowed when I talked. She also says I talked her to sleep. I spoke for about 5 minutes. My sister tries to call. No one is in the room to answer the phone.
