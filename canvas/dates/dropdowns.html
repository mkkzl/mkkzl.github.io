      <h1>Chronic // Chronology</h1>
			<p id="intro">An exploration in tracking daily events, occurrences, and states. A visualization bringing (unrelated?) elements of existence together through algorithms. An exposition of my life with chronic illness presented chronologically. Perhaps a more beautiful way to present each day, perhaps a way to better understand the self, perhaps a way to allow others to enter into this complicated space.
